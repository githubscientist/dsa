    Mathematics for Computer Science
    
    Intuition:
        This session equips the leaners with the basic mathematical tools needed to study computer science and programming. These mathematical tools underlie many of the computer science concepts and techniques that are used in computational thinking and problem solving. 
        
    The session covers the following topics:
        - What is an Algorithm?
        - History of the word "Algorithm"
        - Euclid's Algorithm - Greatest Common Divisor
        - Flowcharts
        - Example to find the GCD of 2 numbers
        - Five important features of an Algorithm
        - Prime Numbers
        - Numbers, Powers and Logarithms
        - Real Numbers
        - Complex Numbers
        - Closed Interval, Open Interval, Half-Open Interval
        - Laws of Exponents
        - Logarithms
            - Common Logarithms
            - Binary Logarithms
            - Natural Logarithms
        - Relationship between Binary Logarithms and Common Logarithms

    Memory Representations:

    This session equips the learners with the basic understanding of how data is stored in the memory of a computer. Also, it gives the students an understanding of how the data is interpreted (as binary) by the computer.

    The session covers the following topics:

    Prime Numbers - Sieve of Erathosthenes (Contd... from Session 2)
    What is a memory ?
    What is a Programming language?
    High level and low level languages
    Machine Language
    Assembly Language
    Number Systems and their inter-conversions
        - Decimal Number System
        - Binary Number System
        - Octal Number System
        - Hexadecimal Number System
    Binary Addition
    Understanding Memory
        - Primary Memory
            - RAM
            - ROM
        - Secondary Memory
            - Hard Disk
            - Floppy Disk
            - CD-ROM
            - DVD
            - Pen Drive
            - SSD: Solid State Drive

    Orientation Session:

    This session gives an overview of the course and its contents. It also provides an overview of the course structure and the learning outcomes of the course.

    The session covers the following topics:

    What is an Algorithm?
    Problem Solving - To check if a number is even number or odd number?
    Different Algorithms and their implementations - Key point: Programming Language is not important
