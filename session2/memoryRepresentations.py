    Different types of Memories:
        - Primary Memory
            - RAM : Random Access Memory
            - ROM
                - types of ROM:
                    - PROM - Programmable ROM
                    - EPROM - Erasable PROM
                    - EEPROM - Electrically Erasable PROM
                    - Flash Memory
        - Secondary Memory
            - Hard Disk
            - Floppy Disk
            - CD
            - DVD
            - Pen Drive
            - Memory Card
            - SSD: Solid State Drive
        - Cache Memory: Fastest memory

    
    All our applications, operating system, games, etc..are executed in RAM.
    RAM has two types of sections:
        - Stack : Static Memory Allocation (Recursion)
